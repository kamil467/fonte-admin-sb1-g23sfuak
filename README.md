---

#### **6. Product Variants Management**
- **Purpose**: Allow admins to manage variants for each product.

---

#### **9. Responsive Design**
- Ensure the UI is mobile-friendly and works seamlessly across devices.

---

### **Visual Design Suggestions**
- **Color Scheme**: Use a professional color palette (e.g., shades of blue, gray, and white) with accent colors for buttons and alerts.
- **Typography**: Use clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans) for readability.
- **Icons**: Use intuitive icons (e.g., FontAwesome or Material Icons) for actions like edit, delete, and add.
- **Spacing**: Maintain consistent padding and margins for a clean layout.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. Admin logs in and sees the **Dashboard**.
2. Clicks on **Manage Products**.
3. Uses the search bar and filters to find a specific product.
4. Edits the product's details, including its region association and variants.
5. Saves changes and returns to the product list.

This design ensures that the admin panel is user-friendly, scalable, and efficient for managing the complex relationships between products, categories, subcategories, and regions. Let me know if you need further details or mockups!
